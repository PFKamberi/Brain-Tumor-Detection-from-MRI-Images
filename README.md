# Brain-Tumor-Detection-from-MRI-Images

My term project for the undergraduate Image Processing course.

The methodology followed by the algorithm implemented is based mostly on [this paper](http://www.hep.upatras.gr/class/download/psi_epe_iko/5-Brain-Tumour-Extraction-from-MRI-Images-Using-MATLAB.PDF)

The data used as input can be downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archive [here](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Brain-Tumor-Progression)
